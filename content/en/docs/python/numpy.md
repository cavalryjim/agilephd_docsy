NumPy is a robust array-processing package designed to efficiently manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays of data.

Numpy arrays are not to confused with a Python list.  Lists are used as containers while numpy arrays are best used for mathematical operations.

## Single data types
Numpy conducts calculations on arrays in a quick and efficient manner.  Numpy assumes that all of the data types inside an array are the same type (int, float, boolean).  If you try to add a string to a numpy array or mix other data types, numpy will convert all the data types to a string.

## Install & import
To install numpy, use the 'pip' or 'pip3' package manager.  If you installed Python using the Anaconda distribution, it likely came with numpy as part of the distribution.
```
$ pip install numpy
$ pip3 install numpy
```
