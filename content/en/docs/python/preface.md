This book is intended to give Information Systems students a foundational understanding
of programming and application development.  To do so, we will need to use a
programming language to better illustrate logic, data structures, and other
important concepts. While there are multiple options, to me, we need a language that is
robust, versatile, popular, and free. There are other languages, such as Ruby, that meet these requirements but the rising popularity of Python plus hundreds of readily available packages gives Python an edge above the competition.

A simple search of 'python popularity' will return pages of articles, blogs, and information about
[The Incredible Growth of Python](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/).

As a comment on the versatility of Python, it comes preloaded on many systems from the
Raspberry Pi to the MacBook Pro.  It is popular within the scientific community,
tech startups and the top software companies including:

- Google
- Instagram
- Spotify
- Quora
- Netflix
- Dropbox
- Reddit
