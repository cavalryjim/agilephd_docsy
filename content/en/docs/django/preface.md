This book is intended to give entrepreneurs students a foundational understanding
of leveraging a development framework to quickly build a MVP.
While there are multiple options, to me, we need a framework that is
robust, versatile, popular, and free. There are other options, such as Rails, that meet these requirements but the rising popularity of Python plus hundreds of readily available packages gives Django an edge above the competition.

A simple search of 'python popularity' will return pages of articles, blogs, and information about
[The Incredible Growth of Python](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/).
